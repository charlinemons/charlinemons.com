                                I'm a Montreal-based Web developer with about 3 years of experience as a web integrator. Trained as a full-stack developer, interested in back-end systems and passionate about front-end development.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                4 years ago, I decided to pivot to a career in web development. I completed a 9-week intensive coding bootcamp (Le Wagon) for which I worked for a session as a teacher assistant and workshop instructor, helping students with coding challenges and answering their questions. This was a great experience after several weeks of learning to complete the training.

                                <br>
                                Over the past 2 years, I had my first experience was a Web Integrator learned HTML, CSS, Figma, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Wordpress -- and many other libraries, frameworks, tools, and technologies. Most of all, I've learned how to think like a developer and gained confidence in the realization that I can easily pick up any new language or tool as needed.

                                <br>
                                Prior to this, I had a career in the retail industry starting as a full-time employee, promoted several times as a visual merchandiser, Team Leader and then manager.

                                <br>
                                Since my new journey as a web developer, I have been dedicated to my goal of becoming a developer.
